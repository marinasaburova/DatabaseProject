# Database Final
This project was the final project for my **CSIT355 Fall 2021 Database Course** at Montclair State University. 

*I have recently made some minor changes to improve the organization and remove redundancy, but I am keeping the site essentially the same.*

For this project, we were required to build an online shopping site with a focus on the database. Before starting this project, I had never used HTML, CSS, PHP or SQL before. We were given little to no guidance on HTML, CSS, and PHP. This site is definitely not the most attractive one, as I was fumbling through HTMl and CSS. I also must admit, I now see many problems with my PHP code. If repeating this with my current knowledge, it would be a lot cleaner. Nevertheless, this project was a big commitment and I am proud of what it is, especially considering my skills at the time.

## Skills Used
- HTML, CSS
- PHP
